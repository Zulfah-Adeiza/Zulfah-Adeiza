# Hi, I'm Zulfah Adeiza 👋

## Turning Complexity into Clarity

I turn complexity into clarity so digital health and SaaS teams can launch better solutions, faster, without getting stuck in analysis loops or scope creep.

With 4+ years in healthcare IT and regulated SaaS environments, I bring a unique blend of clinical insight and technical execution. I started my career in pharmacy and transitioned into business analysis to solve deeper workflow problems at scale, helping teams align faster, deliver smarter, and eliminate rework.
